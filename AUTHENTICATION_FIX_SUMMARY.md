# Complete Fix Summary for Authentication Issues

# This script documents all the changes made to fix authentication across microservices

echo "=== Authentication Fix Summary ==="
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo ""

echo "PROBLEM ANALYSIS:"
echo "- API Gateway correctly extracts JWT and forwards user info via headers (X-User-Id, X-User-Email, X-User-Role)"
echo "- Microservices were using devMode=true OR expecting direct JWT tokens"
echo "- When devMode=false, services required authentication but had no mechanism to read forwarded headers"
echo ""

echo "SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "1. Added jwt.enabled=true and security.devMode=false to all service configurations"
echo "2. Created HeaderBasedSecurityContextRepository for each service"
echo "3. Updated SecurityConfig in each service to use header-based authentication"
echo ""

echo "SERVICES FIXED:"
echo "✅ user-service: Complete (jwt.enabled=true, HeaderBasedSecurityContextRepository, updated SecurityConfig)"
echo "✅ notification-service: Complete (added JWT config, HeaderBasedSecurityContextRepository, updated SecurityConfig)"
echo "✅ project-service: Complete (added JWT config, HeaderBasedSecurityContextRepository, updated SecurityConfig)"
echo "✅ task-service: Complete (added JWT config, HeaderBasedSecurityContextRepository, updated SecurityConfig)"
echo "✅ comment-service: Complete (added JWT config, HeaderBasedSecurityContextRepository, updated SecurityConfig)"
echo ""

echo "CONFIGURATION CHANGES:"
echo ""
echo "1. All services now have in application.yml:"
echo " security:"
echo " devMode: false"
echo " jwt:"
echo " enabled: true"
echo " secret: my-very-secret-key-for-jwt-signing"
echo ""
echo "2. All services have HeaderBasedSecurityContextRepository that reads:"
echo " - X-User-Id header"
echo " - X-User-Email header"
echo " - X-User-Role header"
echo ""
echo "3. All SecurityConfig classes updated to use @ConditionalOnProperty(jwt.enabled=true)"
echo ""

echo "NEXT STEPS:"
echo "1. Restart all microservices to apply configuration changes"
echo "2. Test WebSocket connection (should now work with query parameter authentication)"
echo "3. Test user service endpoints (should now work with USER_READ permission for ROLE_ADMIN and ROLE_PROJECT_MANAGER)"
echo "4. Test notification mark-read functionality"
echo "5. Test project creation with user role filtering"
echo ""

echo "RESTART COMMANDS:"
echo "docker-compose restart user-service"
echo "docker-compose restart notification-service"
echo "docker-compose restart project-service"
echo "docker-compose restart task-service"
echo "docker-compose restart comment-service"
echo ""
echo "OR restart all services:"
echo "docker-compose restart"
