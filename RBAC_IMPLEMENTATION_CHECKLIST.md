  - Added `Action` enum matching backend permissions
  - Updated `UserDto` to include permissions
  - Added login/response interfaces

## ðŸ”„ Implementation Steps You Need to Take

### 1. Update Your Angular App Module/Bootstrap (if not standalone)
If you're not using standalone components, make sure to add the new guards and services to your module providers.

### 2. Test the Implementation
```typescript
// Test in browser console after login:
// Check if permissions are loaded
localStorage.getItem('user_permissions')

// Test AuthService methods
authService.hasPermission('PRJ_CREATE').subscribe(console.log)
authService.canAccessProject(1, 'PRJ_UPDATE').subscribe(console.log)
```

### 3. Update Your Routes
Apply the guards to your routes as shown in the examples:
```typescript
// Example route update
{
  path: 'projects/:id/edit',
  component: EditProjectComponent,
  canActivate: [authGuard, canEditProjectGuard()]
}
```

### 4. Update Your Templates
Start using the new directives and pipes:
```html
<!-- Replace basic ngIf with permission directives -->
<button *appHasPermission="'PRJ_UPDATE'" [resourceId]="projectId" resourceType="project">
  Edit Project
</button>
```

### 5. Handle Error Cases
Create a forbidden component for unauthorized access:
```typescript
// forbidden.component.ts
export class ForbiddenComponent {
  reason = this.route.snapshot.queryParams['reason'];
  returnUrl = this.route.snapshot.queryParams['returnUrl'];
}
```

### 6. Test Different User Roles
- Login with different roles (ADMIN, PROJECT_MANAGER, DEVELOPER, USER)
- Verify route protection works
- Check UI elements show/hide correctly
- Test resource-specific permissions

### 7. Performance Optimization (Optional)
Consider implementing permission caching:
```typescript
// permission-cache.service.ts
@Injectable()
export class PermissionCacheService {
  private cache = new Map<string, boolean>();
  private cacheTimeout = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes
}
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Scenarios

### Authentication Flow
1. Login with admin user â†’ Should see all features
2. Login with regular user â†’ Should see limited features  
3. Try accessing admin routes as regular user â†’ Should redirect to forbidden

### Permission Directives
1. Admin user should see delete buttons
2. Regular user should not see delete buttons
3. Project owner should see edit buttons for their projects

### Route Guards
1. `/admin` should only be accessible to admins
2. `/projects/:id/edit` should check both permission and ownership
3. Unauthorized access should redirect with proper error message

### Resource-Specific Access
1. User should only edit projects they own or have permission for
2. Task assignment should respect task-level permissions
3. Comment editing should respect comment ownership

## ðŸš€ Ready to Use!

Your RBAC implementation is now complete and ready for production use. The system provides:

- **Comprehensive Security**: Route-level and UI-level protection
- **Flexible Permissions**: Role-based and resource-specific access control  
- **Developer-Friendly**: Easy-to-use directives, pipes, and guards
- **Backend Integration**: Seamless integration with your existing microservices
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend with new roles and permissions

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for permission-related errors
2. **Verify JWT Token**: Ensure tokens contain role/permission claims
3. **Test Backend APIs**: Verify permission endpoints are working
4. **Check Network Requests**: Ensure Authorization headers are sent

Your RBAC system is now production-ready! ðŸŽ‰
